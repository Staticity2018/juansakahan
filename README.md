# JuanSakahan, came from two words: 'Juan' (a common tag name for Fipinos), which is homonym with the integer 'one' and 'Sakahan' (means farm). We chose this name for our project, for this will be an all in 'one' web application that would primarily help Filipino rice farmers, handle the common problems they encounter at their rice fields, like pests, weather conditions, for this app will give them informations how to increase their rice production during the cropping season and solutions to variety of problems.
