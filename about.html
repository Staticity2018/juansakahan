    'JuanSakahan' is an web application where rice farmers would primarily benefit, for they will be the target user of this project. The application would have the following features:

- Gives an idea to our dear farmers, the variety of rice that will survive to two primary weather condition specially in the Philippines, like the Amihan and Habagat.

- list of pesticides for variety of pests whether if it's organic or synthetic.

- Primarily available in English, and 2 primary dialects like Cebuano and Tagalog .

- Personal calendar to make the farmers stay on track on the progress of the their rice plants, and estimation of the target date of harvesting that is directly dependent on the variety of rice seeds the farmer had chosen.

- Reservation, or online purchasing of rice seeds directly from DA.

 The software will have a direct collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, whom will be the primary source of information or data for these software. The only problem the team was seeing for this app is the possibility that most of the farmers are not capable of using android phone, and can also be widely affected by very poor internet connection in rural areas. So, we are planning to request these farmers, or any of their family member that could assist them, to have a direct tutorial on how to use the app. We are also planning to make it as an offline application, that can be updated from time to time once it is connected to the internet, or once their will be some data that Department of Agriculture wants to add.
